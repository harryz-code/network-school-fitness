this project was built as part of a vibe coding hackathon on 8/3 at ns - i wanted to dedicate this to everyone who wants to achieve fitness and wellness goals here. hopefully you find it helpful! welcome all contributions.

## why this exists

ns publishes nutrition facts in excel format per component and is hard to estimate. this app makes it easy to track meals, workouts, and water intake specifically tailored for ns residents.
